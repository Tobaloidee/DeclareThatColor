# DeclareThatColor

DeclareThatColor is a Sublime Text 3 plugin that aims to help developers declare CSS hex codes to their human-readable color names.

## Notes

- This plugin will look for 3 and 6-digit hex codes (case insensitive) and will convert them to their 6-digit lowercased notation.
- Multiple hex codes may have the same color name. For example #FFF, #FEFEFE and #FDFDFD yields the name white. If these hex codes are used within a document sequentially from top to bottom, the following variable names will be used respectively: `white`, `white-2` and `white-3`.
- When using the stylus preprocessor; declaration will be prepended with the dollar sign and will have the trailing semicolon.
