# DeclareThatColor

DeclareThatColor is a Sublime Text 3 plugin that aims to help developers declare CSS hex codes to their human-readable color names.

## Behaviors

- This plugin will look for 3 and 6-digit hex codes (case insensitive) and will convert them to their 6-digit lowercase notation.
- Multiple hex codes may have the same color name; for example #FFF, #FEFEFE and #FDFDFD yields the name white. If these hex codes are used sequentially, color names `white`, `white-2` and `white-3` will be given respectively.
- When using the stylus preprocessor, a declaration will be prepended with the dollar sign and will have the trailing semicolon.
- Variable names will be ordered using the [natural sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order) algorithm.
